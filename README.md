ChooseSystem
============

GUI utility to quickly connect to a UTCS machine via either SSH or VNC.
Designed for Windows, to be used with PuTTY and TightVNC, but should be fairly easy to adapt to other systems.

Works best if configured to connect to ssh session using RSA public/private keys.

For a guide on how to do this with PuTTY, see this guide:

For a guide on how to do this with the OpenSSH under GNU/Linux, OS X, or BSD, see this guide:
